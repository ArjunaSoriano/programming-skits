###Adding and removing things by toggling###

Everyone has the same class -- a menu item, a green post it, whatever is handy. To toggle the class, you first must remove the class, and then add a new class to the target item. So, for example, if each student has a green post it note stuck to them, the student who wishes to toggle something would have to find the student they're going to toggle, remove their green postit, then give them a yellow post it. They have officially toggled something. It helps explain how jQuery can toggle a menu item to change the color or font or whatever you want to change.
